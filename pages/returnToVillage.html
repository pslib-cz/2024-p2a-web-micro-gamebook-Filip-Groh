            <p>
                You carefully place the Sunstone in your backpack and retrace your steps through the woods. The journey back seems shorter, the dangers less daunting. You emerge from the woods just as the sun begins to rise, the villagers waiting for you with bated breath.
            </p>
            <p>
                You present them with the Sunstone, and joy erupts throughout the village. You are hailed as a hero, your name whispered with awe and respect. You have brought light and prosperity back to the village, and your legend will forever be remembered.
